                        I moved to the UK seven years ago from Italy, where I worked both in retail and as a photo editor.
                        I have worked in the retail industry for many years, before I decided to pursue my passion and become a web developer.

                    <p>
                        This has fortunately proven to be a strength, since it has given me a client-focused perspective.
                        The client's needs are my north star whenever Iâ€™m working on a website.

                    I'm a self taught developer, and although I never lose sight of the fundamentals (<em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>Javascript</em>)
                    I'm constantly studying to enrich my skillset: I'm currently studying <em>React</em>, and I'm using it in my latest projects.
                    I've also learned the basics of git and GitHub, npm, Adobe XD. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                    In my years working in a graphic design studio I've also learned Photoshop, Illustrator, Cinema 4D, and I use them on an almost daily basis.
